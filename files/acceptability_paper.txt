Definition 2. An argumentation framework is a pair
AF = (AR, attacks)
where AR is a set of arguments, and attacks is a binary relation on AR, i.e.
attacks \<subseteq> AR x AR.
For two arguments A and B, the meaning of attacks(A, B) is that A represents
an attack against B.
§
Example 3 (Continuation of Example 1). The exchange between I and A can be
represented by an argumentation framework (AR, attacks) as follows: AR =
{i_1, i_2, a} and attacks = {(i_1, a), (a, i_1), (i_2, a)} with i_1 and i_2 denoting the first and
the second argument of I, respectively, and a denoting the argument of A. 
§
Definition 5. A set S of arguments is said to be conflict-free if there are no
arguments A and B in S such that A attacks B.
§
Definition 6.
(1) An argument A \<in> AR is acceptable with respect to a set S of arguments iff
for each argument B \<in> AR: if B attacks A then B is attacked by S (see Remark 4).
(2) A conflict-free set of arguments S is admissible iff each argument in S is
acceptable with respect to S.
§
Definition 7. A preferred extension of an argumentation framework AF is a
maximal (with respect to set inclusion) admissible set of AF.
§
Lemma 10 (Fundamental Lemma). Let S be an admissible set of arguments, and A
and A’ be arguments which are acceptable with respect to S. Then
(1) S’ = S \<union> {A} is admissible, and
(2) A’ is acceptable with respect to S’.
Proof. (1) We need only to show that S’ is conflict-free. Assume the contrary.
Therefore, there exists an argument B \<in> S such that either A attacks B or B
attacks A. From the admissibility of S and the acceptability of A, there is an
argument B’ in S such that B’ attacks B or B’ attacks A. Since S is conflict-free,
it follows that B’ attacks A. But then there is an argument B” in S such that B”
attacks B’. Contradiction!
(2) Obvious. \<box>
§
Theorem 11. Let AF be an argumentation framework.
(1) The set of all admissible sets of AF form a complete partial order with
respect to set inclusion.
§
(2) For each admissible set S of AF, there exists a preferred extension E of AF
such that S \<subseteq> E.
§
Corollary 12. Every argumentation framework possesses at least one preferred
extension.
§
Definition 13. A conflict-free set of arguments S is called a stable extension iff S
attacks each argument which does not belong to S.
§
Lemma 14. S is a stable extension iff S = {A|A is not attacked by S}.
§
Lemma 15. Every stable extension is a preferred extension, but not vice versa.
Proof. It is clear that each stable extension is a preferred extension. To show that
the reverse does not hold, we construct the following argumentation framework:
Let AF = (AR, attacks) with AR = {A} and attacks = {(A, A)}. It is clear that the
empty set is a preferred extension of AF which is clearly not stable. \<box>
§
Definition 16. The characteristic function, denoted by FAF, of an argumentation
framework AF = (AR. attacks) is defined as follows:
F_AF:2^AR \<rightarrow> 2^AR,
F_AF(S) = {A | A is acceptable with respect to S}.
§
Remark 17. As we always refer to an arbitrary but fixed argumentation framework AF, we often write F instead of FAF for short.
§
Lemma 18. A conflict-free set S of arguments is admissible iff S \<subseteq> F(S).
Proof. The lemma follows immediately from the property “If S is conflict-free,
then F(S) is also conflict-free”. So we need only to prove this property. Assume
that there are A and A’ in F(S) such that A attacks A’. Thus, there exists B in S
such that B attacks A. Hence there is B’ in S such that B’ attacks B.
Contradiction! So F(S) is conflict-free. \<box>
§
Lemma 19. F_AF is monotonic (with respect to set inclusion).
§
Definition 20. The grounded extension of an argumentation framework AF,
denoted by GE_AF, is the least fixed point of F_AF.
§
Example 21 (Continuation of Example 8). It is easy to see that
F_AF(\<Phi>) = {i_2}, F_AF^2(\<Phi>) = {i_1,i_2}, F_AF^3(\<Phi>)=F_AF^2(\<Phi>).
Thus GE_AF = {i_1, i_2}. Note that GE_AF is also the only preferred extension of AF.
§
Example 3 (Continuation of Example 1). The exchange between I and A can be
represented by an argumentation framework (AR, attacks) as follows: AR =
{i_1, i_2, a} and attacks = {(i_1, a), (a, i_1), (i_2, a)} with i_1 and i_2 denoting the first and
the second argument of I, respectively, and a denoting the argument of A.
§
Remark 4. From now on, if not explicitly mentioned otherwise, we always refer
to an arbitrary but fixed argumentation framework AF = (AR, attacks). Further,
we say that A attacks B (or B is attacked by A) if attacks(A, B) holds. Similarly,
we say that a set S of arguments attacks B (or B is attacked by S) if B is attacked
by an argument in S.
