I am formalizing Edmund Landau's book "Foundations of Analysis" in the Isar language of the Isabelle proof assistant. For technical reasons, I need to write "1" as "I" and the successor function "x'" as "succ x" in the formalization.

I am translating the natural language proof into a formal proof statement by statement as follows:

Input: 
Theorem 1: If 
$$x \neq y$$
then
$$x' \neq y'.$$

Output:
theorem Theorem_1: "∀x y. (x ≠ y ⟶ succ x ≠ succ y)"

Input:
Proof: Otherwise, we would have
$$x' = y'$$

Output:
proof -
  {
    fix x y assume "succ x = succ y"

Input:
and hence, by Axiom 4,
$$x = y.$$

Output:
    from this Axiom_4 have "x = y" sorry
  }
(* Finish proof by deducing theorem statement. *)
  from this show "∀x y. (x ≠ y ⟶ succ x ≠ succ y)" sorry
qed

Input:
Theorem 2: $x' \neq x.$

Output:
theorem Theorem_2: "∀x. succ x ≠ x"

Input:
Proof: Let $\mathfrak{M}$ be the set of all $x$ for which this holds true.

Output:
proof -
  define M where "M ≡ {x. succ x ≠ x}"

Input:
I) By Axiom 1 and Axiom 3,
$$1' \neq 1;$$

Output:
  {
    from Axiom_3 have "succ I ≠ I" sorry

Input:
therefore $1$ belongs to $\mathfrak{M}$.

Output:
    from this have "I ∈ M" (* sledgehammer *) sorry
  }

Input:
II) If $x$ belongs to $\mathfrak{M}$,

Output:
  {
    fix x assume "x ∈ M"

Input:
then
$$x' \neq x,$$

Output:
    from this have "succ x ≠ x" sorry

Inpout:
and hence by Theorem 1,
$$(x')' \neq x',$$

Output:
    from this Theorem_1 have "succ (succ x) ≠ succ x" sorry

Input:
so that $x'$ belongs to $\mathfrak{M}$.

Output:
    from this have "succ x ∈ M" sorry
  }

Input:
By Axiom 5, $\mathfrak{M}$ therefore contains all the natural numbers,

Output:
  from Axiom_5 have "∀x. x ∈ M" sorry

Input:
i.e.\ we have for each $x$ that
$$x' \neq x.$$

Output:
(* This is identical to the theorem statement, so it finishes the proof. *)
  from this show "∀x. succ x ≠ x" sorry
qed

Input:
Theorem 3: If
$$x \neq 1,$$
then there exists one (hence, by Axiom 4, exactly one) $u$ such that
$$x = u'.$$

Output: 
theorem Theorem_3: "∀x. (x ≠ I ⟶ (∃!u. x = succ u))

Now please help me to formalize the remainder of the text statement by statement. Let's start with the first statement in the proof of Theorem 3. Please only translate the given input into the Isar language and don't try to guess how the proof continues afterwards.

Input:
Proof: Let $\mathfrak{M}$ be the set consisting of the number $1$ and of all those $x$ for which there exists such a $u$.

My apologies for the confusion. This error is indicating that the goal presented by the show command doesn't match what is actually left to prove. In the Isar proof language, the show command is used to indicate what you're about to prove and should correspond to the statement of the theorem or a significant subgoal within the proof.

You're right that we need to correct this. In this case, the goal is to show that for all x ≠ I, there exists a u such that x = succ u. We can accomplish this by restructuring the proof slightly:

Isabelle

  {
    fix x assume "x ≠ I"
    from ‹∀x. x ∈ M› have "x ∈ M" by simp
    then have "∃u. x = succ u" sorry
  }
  thus "∀x. x ≠ I ⟶ (∃u. x = succ u)" by auto

Here, the fix and assume commands are used to specify the particular x we're considering, which is an arbitrary natural number distinct from I. We then use the previous result (∀x. x ∈ M) to show that x is in M, and hence that there exists a u such that x = succ u. Finally, the thus command is used to infer the original goal from the results we've obtained.

The sorry keyword is a placeholder indicating that we haven't fully formalized the proof. It would need to be replaced with actual proof steps to create a complete formalization.

The by simp and by auto at the ends of proof lines are proof methods that automate some of the simpler steps in the proof. For example, by simp performs simplification, and by auto uses a combination of methods to try to prove the goal automatically.

I apologize for the confusion earlier. Indeed, the error indicates that we are trying to conclude the proof before all necessary steps have been formalized. We should actually continue the inner proof block that handles the case where x ≠ I and belongs to M. Let's adjust the translation as follows:

Isabelle

{
  fix x assume "x ≠ I"
  from ‹∀x. x ∈ M› have "x ∈ M" by simp
  from this M_def have "∃u. x = succ u" sorry
}

Here, M_def is the definition of M we established earlier, which is {I} ∪ {x. ∃u. x = succ u}. The have statement with M_def allows us to deduce that there exists u such that x = succ u, given that x belongs to M.

Please note that the sorry keyword is used here as a placeholder and would need to be replaced with the actual proof steps for a complete proof.

The natural language proof ends here. But if I enter "qed" in Isar, it produces the following error:

Failed to finish proof:
goal (1 subgoal):
 1. ∀x. x ≠ I ⟶ (∃!u. x = succ u)

Please suggest what to add before "qed" in order to correct this error.

The error indicates that the proof is not yet complete. The statement you are trying to prove is of the form "for all x, if x is not I, then there exists a unique u such that x equals the successor of u", but the current state of the proof only establishes the existence of such a u, not its uniqueness.

To finish the proof, you will need to prove that the u is unique. The uniqueness will likely follow from Axiom 4, which asserts the uniqueness of the predecessor.

A possible sketch of what the final part of the proof could look like is:

Isabelle

  {
    fix x assume "x ≠ I"
    from ‹∀x. x ∈ M› have "x ∈ M" by simp
    from this M_def have "∃u. x = succ u" sorry
    then obtain u where "x = succ u" by auto
    moreover have "∀v. x = succ v ⟶ v = u" sorry
    ultimately have "∃!u. x = succ u" by auto
  }
  thus "∀x. x ≠ I ⟶ (∃!u. x = succ u)" by auto
qed

Here, the obtain command is used to choose a specific u for which x = succ u. Then, the moreover command introduces the claim that this u is unique, which needs to be justified (currently marked sorry). The ultimately command is then used to combine the previously introduced facts to establish the existence and uniqueness of u (notated as ∃!u. x = succ u). The final thus command is then used to wrap up the proof.

Again, note that the sorry keywords are placeholders and need to be replaced with actual proofs.

I need to teach you how to translate chained equations:

Input:

    from eq5_1 eq5_2 eq5_3 have "(x❙+y)❙+I = x❙+(y❙+I)" by auto

I apologize for the oversight. You are correct, the statement "∀z. z ∈ M" is not the final goal of the proof but a step in the proof. The goal we want to show is "∀x y z. x ❙+ y ❙+ z = x ❙+ (y ❙+ z)".

The error indicates that we have not yet concluded the proof, i.e., we have not shown the theorem statement to be true. From "∀z. z ∈ M", we can deduce "∀x y z. x ❙+ y ❙+ z = x ❙+ (y ❙+ z)", because being in M is defined exactly as satisfying the equation "x ❙+ y ❙+ z = x ❙+ (y ❙+ z)". Here is how you can continue:

Isabelle

  {
    fix z have "z ∈ M" using ‹∀z. z ∈ M› by auto
    then have "(x❙+y)❙+z = x❙+(y❙+z)" using M_def by auto
  }
  thus "∀z. (x❙+y)❙+z = x❙+(y❙+z)" by auto

Here, thus is used to infer the statement of the theorem from what we have shown so far, and then qed finishes the proof.

I apologize for the misunderstanding. We should be using thus at a higher level of the proof structure. Let's end the inner proof context first:

Isabelle

  qed (* This ends the inner proof context, where z ∈ M implies the equation holds. *)
  (* Now we need to show that this fact leads to the theorem for all x, y, and z. *)
  from ‹∀z. z ∈ M› M_def have "∀z. (x + y) + z = x + (y + z)" by auto
  }
qed

In this revised snippet, qed is used to finish the proof that if z is in M, then the equation holds. Then, we show that since all z are in M, the equation holds for all z, and this statement is directly equivalent to the theorem we want to prove, which completes the outer proof context.

Please note that the sorry keyword has been used as placeholders and would need to be replaced with the actual proof steps for a complete proof.

I apologize for the oversight. Your objective is to prove the theorem "∀x y z. x + y + z = x + (y + z)". You have shown it for a specific x and y, but need to generalize it to any x and y. You can do this by using show again at the end of the proof.

Here's how you should proceed:

Isabelle

  qed (* This ends the inner proof context, where z ∈ M implies the equation holds. *)
  (* Now we need to show that this fact leads to the theorem for all x, y, and z. *)
  from ‹∀z. z ∈ M› M_def have "∀z. (x + y) + z = x + (y + z)" by auto
  }
  thus "∀x y z. (x + y) + z = x + (y + z)" by auto
qed

In this corrected snippet, the inner proof context is finished with qed. The from ... have statement establishes that the equality holds for all z, given specific x and y, as this is the definition of z being in M. The thus keyword is used to generalize the previously shown statement to any x, y, and z, which is the statement of the theorem. Finally, the qed at the end finishes the proof of the theorem.
