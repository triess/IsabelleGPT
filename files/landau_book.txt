Theorem 1: If
x \<noteq> y
then
x' \<noteq> y'.
Proof: Otherwise, we would have
x' = y'
and hence, by Axiom 4,
x = y.

Theorem 2: x' \<noteq> x.
Proof: Let \<MM> be the set of all x for which this holds true.
I) By Axiom 1 and Axiom 3,
1' \<noteq> 1;
therefore 1 belongs to \<MM>.
II) If x belongs to \<MM>, then
x' \<noteq> x,
and hence by Theorem 1,
(x')' \<noteq> x',
so that x' belongs to \<MM>.
By Axiom 5, \<MM> therefore contains all the natural numbers, i.e.
we have for each x that
x' \<noteq> x.

Theorem 3: If
x \<noteq> 1,
then there exists one (hence, by Axiom 4, exactly one) u such that
x = u'.
Proof: Let \<MM> be the set consisting of the number 1 and of all
those x for which there exists such a u. (For any such x, we have
of necessity that
x \<noteq> 1
by Axiom 3.)
I) 1 belongs to \<MM>.
II) If x belongs to \<MM>, then, with u denoting the number x,
we have
x' = u',
so that x' belongs to \<MM>.
By Axiom 5, \<MM> therefore contains all the natural numbers;
thus for each
x \<noteq> 1
there exists a u such that
x = u'.

Theorem 4, and at the same time Definition 1: To every pair
of numbers x, y, we may assign in exactly one way a natural num-
number, called x + y (+ to be read "plus"), such that
1) x + 1 = x' for every x,
2) x + y' = (x + y)' for every x and every y.
x + y is called the sum of x and y, or the number obtained by
addition of y to x.
Proof: A) First we will show that for each fixed x there is
at most one possibility of defining x + y for all y in such a way that
x + 1 = x'
and
x + y' = (x + y)' for every y.
Let a\<^sub>y and b\<^sub>y be defined for all y and be such that
a\<^sub>1 = x', b\<^sub>1 = x'
a\<^bsub>y'\<^esub> = (a\<^sub>y)', b\<^bsub>y'\<^esub> = (b\<^sub>y)' for every y.
Let \<MM> be the set of all y for which
a\<^sub>y = b\<^sub>.
I) a\<^sub>1 = x' = b\<^sub>1;
hence 1 belongs to \<MM>.
II) If y belongs to \<MM>, then
a\<^sub>y = b\<^sub>y,
hence by Axiom 2,
(a\<^sub>y)' = (b\<^sub>y)',
therefore
a\<^bsub>y'\<^esub> = (a\<^sub>y)' = (b\<^sub>y)' = b\<^bsub>y'\<^esub>,
so that y' belongs to \<MM>.
Hence \<MM> is the set of all natural numbers; i.e. for every y we
have
a\<^sub>y = b\<^sub>y.

B) Now we will show that for each x it is actually possible to
define x + y for all y in such a way that
x + 1 = x'
and
x + y' = (x + y)' for every y.
Let \<MM> be the set of all x for which this is possible (in exactly
one way, by A)).
I) For
x = 1,
the number
x + y = y'
is as required, since
x + 1 = 1' = x',
x + y' = (y')' = (x + y)'.
Hence 1 belongs to \<MM>.
II) Let x belong to \<MM>, so that there exists an x + y for all y.
Then the number
x' + y = (x + y)''
is the required number for x', since
x' + 1 = (x + 1)' = (x')'
and
x' + y' = (x + y')' = ((x+y)')' = (x' + y)'.
Hence x' belongs to \<MM>.
Therefore \<MM> contains all x.
Theorem 5 (Associative Law of Addition) :
(x + y) + z = x + (y + z).
Proof: Fix x and y, and denote by \<MM> the set of all z for which
the assertion of the theorem holds.
I) (x + y) + 1 = (x + y)' = x + y' = x + (y + 1);
thus 1 belongs to \<MM>.
II) Let z belong to \<MM>. Then
(x + y) + z = x + (y + z),
hence
(x + y) + z' = ((x+y) +z)' = (x + (y + z))' = x + (y + z)' = x + (y + z'),
so that z' belongs to \<MM>.
Therefore the assertion holds for all z.


Theorem 6 (Commutative Law of Addition) :
x + y = y + x.
Proof: Fix y, and let \<MM> be the set of all x for which the
assertion holds.
I) We have
y + 1 = y',
and furthermore, by the construction in the proof of Theorem 4,
1 + y = y',
so that
1 + y = y + 1
and 1 belongs to \<MM>.
II) If a belongs to \<MM>, then
x + y = y + x,
therefore
(x + y)' = (y + x)' = y + x'.
By the construction in the proof of Theorem 4, we have
x' + y = (x + y)',
hence
x' + y = y + x',
so that x' belongs to \<MM>.
The assertion therefore holds for all x.

Theorem 7: y \<noteq> x + y.
Proof: Fix x, and let \<MM> be the set of all y for which the assertion holds.
I) 1 \<noteq> x',
1 \<noteq> x + 1;
1 belongs to \<MM>.
II) If y belongs to \<MM>, then
y \<noteq> x + y,
hence
y' \<noteq> (x + y)',
y' \<noteq> x + y'.
so that y' belongs to \<MM>.
Therefore the assertion holds for all y.

Theorem 8: If
y \<noteq> z
then
x + y \<noteq> x + z.
Proof: Consider a fixed y and a fixed z such that
y \<noteq> z,
and let \<MM> be the set of all x for which
x + y \<noteq> x + z.
I) y' \<noteq> z',
1 + y \<noteq> 1 + z;
hence 1 belongs to \<MM>.
II) If x belongs to \<MM>, then
x + y \<noteq> x + z,
hence
(x + y)' \<noteq> (x + z)',
x' + y \<noteq> x' + z,
so that x' belongs to \<MM>.
Therefore the assertion holds always.

Theorem 9: For given x and y, exactly one of the following
must be the case:
1) x = y.
2) There exists a u (exactly one, by Theorem 8) such that
x = y + u.
3) There exists a v (exactly one, by Theorem 8) such that
y = x + v.
Proof: A) By Theorem 7, cases 1) and 2) are incompatible.
Similarly, 1) and 3) are incompatible. The incompatibility of 2)
and 3) also follows from Theorem 7; for otherwise, we would have
x = y + u = (x + v) + u = x + (v + u) = (v + u) + x.
Therefore we can have at most one of the cases 1), 2) and 3).
B) Let x be fixed, and let \<MM> be the set of all y for which one
(hence by A), exactly one) of the cases 1), 2) and 3) obtains.
I) For y = 1, we have by Theorem 3 that either
x = 1 = y (case 1))
or
x = u' = 1 + u = y + u (case 2)).
Hence 1 belongs to \<MM>.
II) Let y belong to \<MM>. Then
either (case 1) for y)
x = y
hence
y' = y + 1 = x + 1 (case 3) for y');
or (case 2) for y)
x = y + u,
hence if
u = 1,
then
x = y + 1 = y' (case 1) for y');
but if
u \<noteq> 1,
then, by Theorem 3,
u = w' = 1 + w,
x = y + (1 + w) = (y + 1) + w = y' + w (case 2) for y');
or (case 3) for y)
y= x + v,
hence
y' = (x + v)' = x + v' (case 3) for y').
In any case, y' belongs to \<MM>.
Therefore we always have one of the cases 1),2) and 3).

Definition 2: If
x = y + u
then
x > y.
(> to be read "is greater than.")

Definition 3: If
y = x + v
then
x < y.
(< to be read "is less than.")

Theorem 10: For any given x, y, we have exactly one of the cases
x = y, x > y, x < y.
Proof: Theorem 9, Definition 2 and Definition 3.

Theorem 11: If
x > y
then
y < x.
Proof: Each of these means that
x = y + u
for some suitable u.

Theorem 12: If
x < y
then
y > x.
Proof: Each of these means that
y = x + v
for some suitable v.

Definition 4: x \<ge> y
means
x > y or x = y.
(\<ge> to be read "is greater than or equal to.")

Definition 5: x \<le> y
means
x < y or x = y.
(\<le> to be read "is less than or equal to.")

Theorem 13: If
x \<ge> y
then
y \<le> x.
Proof: Theorem 11.

Theorem 14: If
x \<le> y
then
y \<ge> x.
Proof: Theorem 12.

Theorem 15 (Transitivity of Ordering): If
x < y, y < z,
then
x < z.
Preliminary Remark: Thus if
x > y, y > z,
then
x > z,
since
z < y, y < x,
z < x;
but in what follows I will not even bother to write down such
statements, which are obtained trivially by simply reading the
formulas backwards.
Proof: With suitable v, w, we have
y = x + v, z = y + w,
hence
z = (x + v) + w = x + (v + w),
x < z.

Theorem 16: If
x \<le> y, y < z or x < y, y \<le> z,
then
x < z.
Proof: Obvious if an equality sign holds in the hypothesis:
otherwise, Theorem 15 does it.

Theorem 17: If
x \<le> y, y \<le> z,
then
x \<le> z.
Proof: Obvious if two equality signs hold in the hypothesis;
otherwise, Theorem 16 does it.
A notation such as
a < b \<le> c < d
is justified on the basis of Theorems 15 and 17. While its
immediate meaning is
a < b, b \<le> c, c < d,
it also implies, according to these theorems, that, say
a < c, a < d, b < d.
(Similarly in the later chapters.)

Theorem 18: x + y > x.
Proof: x + y = x + y.

Theorem 19: If
x > y, or x = y, or x < y,
then
x + z > y + z, or x + z = y + z, or x + z < y + z,
respectively.
Proof: 1) If
x > y
then
x = y + u,
x + z = (y + u) + z = (u + y) + z = u + (y + z) = (y + z) + u,
x + z > y + z.
2) If
x = y
then clearly
x + z = y + z.
3) If
x < y
then
y > x,
hence, by 1),
y + z > x + z,
x + z < y + z.

Theorem 20: If
x + z > y + z, or x + z = y + z, or x + z < y + z,
then
x > y, or x = y, or x < y, respectively.
Proof: Follows from Theorem 19, since the three cases are, in
both instances, mutually exclusive and exhaust all possibilities.

Theorem 21: If
x > y, z > u,
then
x + z > y + u.
Proof: By Theorem 19, we have
x + z > y + z
and
y + z = z + y > u + y = y + u,
hence
x + z > y + u.

Theorem 22: If
x \<ge> y, z > u or x > y, z \<ge> u,
then
x + z > y + u.
Proof: Follows from Theorem 19 if an equality sign holds in
the hypothesis, otherwise from Theorem 21.

Theorem 23: If
x \<ge> y, z \<ge> u,
then
x + z \<ge> y + u.
Proof: Obvious if two equality signs hold in the hypothesis;
otherwise Theorem 22 does it.

Theorem 24: x \<ge> 1.
Proof: Either
x = 1
or
x = u' = u + 1 > 1.

Theorem 25: If y > x
then
y \<ge> x + 1.
Proof: y = x + u,
u \<ge> 1,
hence
y \<ge> x + 1.

Theorem 26: If
y < x + 1
then
y \<le> x.
Proof: Otherwise we would have
y > x
and therefore, by Theorem 25,
y \<ge> x + 1.

Theorem 27: In every non-empty set of natural numbers
there is a least one (i.e. one which is less than any other number
of the set).
Proof: Let \<NN> be the given set, and let \<MM> be the set of all x
which are \<le> every number of \<NN>.
By Theorem 24, the set \<MM> contains the number 1. Not every
x belongs to \<MM>; in fact, for each y of \<NN> the number y + 1 does
not belong to \<MM>, since
y + 1 > y.
Therefore there is an m in \<MM> such that m + 1 does not belong
to \<MM>; for otherwise, every natural number would have to belong
to \<MM>, by Axiom 5.
Of this m I now assert that it is \<le> every n of \<NN>, and that it belongs
to \<NN>. The former we already know. The latter is established by an
indirect argument, as follows: If m did not belong to \<NN> then for
each n of \<NN> we would have
m < n,
hence, by Theorem 25,
m + 1 \<le> n;
thus m + 1 would belong to \<MM>, contradicting the statement above
by which m was introduced.

Theorem 28 and at the same time Definition 6: To every pair 
of numbers x, y, we may assign in exactly one way a natural num- 
number, called x ⋅ y ( ⋅ to be read "times"; however, the dot is usually 
omitted), such that 
1) x ⋅ 1 = x             for every x, 
2) x ⋅ y' = x ⋅ y + x    for every x and every y. 
x ⋅ y is called the product of x and y, or the number obtained 
from multiplication of x by y. 
Proof (mutatis mutandis, word for word the same as that
of Theorem 4): A) We will first show that for each fixed x there
is at most one possibility of defining xy for all y in such a way that 
x ⋅ 1 = x 
and 
xy' = xy + x for every y. 
Let a_y and b_y be defined for all y and be such that 
a_1 = x, b_1 = x, 
a_y' = a_y + x, b_y' = b_y + x for every y. 
Let \<MM> be the set of all y for which 
a_y = b_y. 
I) a_1 = x = b_1; 
hence 1 belongs to \<MM>. 
II) If y belongs to \<MM>, then 
a_y = b_y, 
hence 
a_y' = a_y + x = b_y + x = b_y', 
so that y' belongs to \<MM>. 
Hence \<MM> is the set of all natural numbers; i.e. for every y we 
have 
a_y = b_y. 
B) Now we will show that for each x, it is actually possible to 
define xy for all y in such a way that 
x ⋅ 1 = x 
and 
xy' = xy + x for every y. 
Let \<MM> be the set of all x for which this is possible (in exactly 
one way, by A)). 
I) For 
x = l, 
the number 
xy = y 
is as required, since 
x ⋅ 1 = 1 = x, 
xy' = y' = y + 1 = xy + x. 
Hence 1 belongs to \<MM>. 
II) Let x belong to \<MM>, so that there exists an xy for all y. Then 
the number 
x'y = xy + y 
is the required number for x' since
x' ⋅ 1 = x ⋅ 1 + 1 = x + 1 = x'
and 
x'y' = xy' y' = (xy + x) + y' = xy + (x + y') = xy + (x + y)'
  = xy + (x' + y) = xy + (y + x') = (xy + y) + x' = x'y + x'.
Hence x' belongs to \<MM>. 
Therefore \<MM> contains all x.

Theorem 28_a (helper theorem):
For all x,y we have:
x'y = xy + y

Theorem 29 (Commutative Law of Multiplication): 
xy = yx. 
Proof: Fix y, and let \<MM> be the set of all x for which the assertion holds. 
I) We have 
y ⋅ 1 = y,
and furthermore, by the construction in the proof of Theorem 28, 
1 ⋅ y = y, 
hence 
1 ⋅ y = y ⋅ 1, 
so that 1 belongs to \<MM>. 
II) If x belongs to \<MM>, then 
xy = yx, 
hence 
xy + y = yx + y = yx'. 
By the construction in the proof of Theorem 28, we have 
x'y = xy + y, 
hence 
x'y = yx', 
so that x' belongs to \<MM>. 
The assertion therefore holds for all x.

Theorem 30 (Distributive Law): 
x(y + z) = xy + xz. 
Preliminary Remark: The formula 
(y + z)x = yx + zx 
which results from Theorem 30 and Theorem 29, and similar 
analogues later on, need not be specifically formulated as theorems, 
nor even be set down. 
Proof: Fix x and y, and let \<MM> be the set of all z for which the 
assertion holds true. 
I) x(y + 1) = xtf = xy + x = xy + x ⋅ 1; 
1 belongs to \<MM>. 
II) If z belongs to \<MM>, then 
x(y + z) = xy + xz,
hence 
x(y + z') x((y + z)') = x(y + z) + x = (xy + xz) +x
  = xy + (xz + x) = xy + xz' 
so that z' belongs to \<MM>. 
Therefore, the assertion always holds.

Theorem 31 (Associative Law of Multiplication): 
(xy)z = x(yz). 
Proof: Fix x and y, and let \<MM> be the set of all z for which the 
assertion holds true. 
I) (xy) ⋅ l = xy = x(y ⋅ 1) ; 
hence 1 belongs to \<MM>. 
II) Let z belong to \<MM>. Then 
(xy)z = x(yz), 
and therefore, using Theorem 30, 
(xy)z' = (xy)z + xy = x(yz) + xy = x(yz + y) = x(yz'), 
so that z' belongs to \<MM>. 
Therefore \<MM> contains all natural numbers. 

Theorem 32: If 
x > y, or x = y, or x < y, 
then 
xz > yz, or xz = yz, or xz < yz, respectively. 
Proof: 1) If 
x > y 
then 
x = y + u, 
xz = (y + u)z = yz + uz > yz. 
2) If 
x = y
then clearly
xz = yz.
3) If 
x < y
then 
y > x,
hence by 1),
yz > xz,
xz < yz.

Theorem 33: If
xz > yz, or xz = yz, or xz < yz, 
then 
x > y, or x = y, or x < y, respectively. 
Proof: Follows from Theorem 32, since the three cases are, in 
both instances, mutually exclusive and exhaust all possibilities. 

Theorem 34: If 
x > y, z> u, 
then 
xz > yu. 
Proof: By Theorem 32, we have 
xz > yz 
and 
yz = zy > uy = yu, 
hence 
xz > yu. 

Theorem 35: If
x \<ge> y, z > u or x > y, z \<ge> u, 
then 
xz > yu. 
Proof: Follows from Theorem 32 if an equality sign holds in 
the hypothesis; otherwise from Theorem 34. 

Theorem 36: If 
x \<ge> y, z \<ge> u, 
then 
xz \<ge> yu. 
Proof: Obvious if two equality signs hold in the hypothesis; 
otherwise Theorem 35 does it. 

Definition 7: By a fraction x_1/x_2 (read "x_1 over x_2") is meant the pair of natural numbers x_1, x_2 (in this order).

Definition 8: 
x_1/x_2 ~ y_1/y_2
(~ to be read "equivalent") if
x_1y_2 = y_1x_2.

Theorem 37: x_1/x_2 ~ x_1/x_2.
Proof: x_1x_2 = x_1x_2.

Theorem 38: If
x_1/x_2 ~ y_1/y_2
then
y_1/y_2 ~ x_1/x_2.
Proof: x_1y_2 = y_1x_2,
hence
y_1x_2 = x_1y_2.

Theorem 39: If
x_1/x_2 ~ y_1/y_2, y_1/y_2 ~ z_1/z_2
then
x_1/x_2 ~ z_1/z_2.
Proof:
x_1y_2 = y_1x_2, y_1z_2 = z_1y_2,
hence
(x_1y_2)(y_1z_2) = (y_1x_2)(z_1y_2).
We always have
(xy)(zu) = x(y(zu)) = x((yz)u) = x(u(yz)) = (xu)(yz)
  = (xu)(zy);
therefore
(x_1y_2)(y_1z_2) = (x_1z_2)(y_1y_2)
and
(y_1x_2)(z_1y_2) = (y_1y_2)(z_1x_2) = (z_1x_2)(y_1y_2),
so that, by the above, we have
(x_1z_2)(y_1y_2) = (z_1x_2)(y_1y_2),
x_1z_2 = z_1x_2.

Lemma: By Theorems 37 through 39, all fractions fall into classes, in
such a way that 
x_1/x_2 ~ y_1/y_2
if and only if x_1/x_2 and y_1/y_2 belong to the same class.

Theorem 40: x_1/x_2 ~ (x_1x)/(x_2x).
Proof: x_1(x_2x) = x_1(xx_2) = (x_1x)x_2.

Definition 9: x_1/x_2 > y_1/y_2
(> to be read "is greater than") if
x_1y_2 > y_1x_2.

Definition 10: x_1/x_2 < y_1/y_2
(< to be read "is less than") if
x_1y_2 < y_1x_2.

Theorem 41: If x_1/x_2, y_1/y_2 are arbitrary, then one of
x_1/x_2 ~ y_1/y_2, x_1/x_2 > y_1/y_2, x_1/x_2 < y_1/y_2
is the case.
Proof: For our x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2, exactly one of
x_1y_2 = y_1x_2, x_1y_2 > y_1x_2, x_1y_2 < y_1x_2
is the case.

Theorem 42: If
x_1/x_2 > y_1/y_2
then
y_1/y_2 < x_1/x_2.
Proof: If
x_1y_2 > y_1x_2
then
y_1x_2 < x_1y_2.

Theorem 43: If
x_1/x_2 < y_1/y_2
then
y_1/y_2 > x_1/x_2.
Proof: If
x_1y_2 < y_1x_2
then
y_1x_2 > x_1y_2.

Theorem 44: If
x_1/x_2 > y_1/y_2, x_1/x_2 ~ z_1/z_2, y_1/y_2 ~ u_1/u_2
then
z_1/z_2 > u_1/u_2.
Preliminary Remark: Thus if a fraction of one class is greater 
than a fraction of another class, then the same will be true for
all pairs of representatives of the two classes.
Proof: y_1u_2 = u_1y_2, z_1x_2 = x_1z_2, x_1y_2 > y_1x_2,
hence
(y_1u_2)(z_1x_2) = (u_1y_2)(x_1z_2),
and therefore, by Theorem 32,
(y_1x_2)(z_1u_2) = (u_1z_2)(x_1y_2) > (u_1z_2)(y_1x_2),
so that, by Theorem 33,
z_1u_2 > u_1z_2.

Theorem 45: If
x_1/x_2 < y_1/y_2, x_1/x_2 ~ z_1/z_2, y_1/y_2 ~ u_1/u_2
then
z_1/z_2 < u_1/u_2.
Preliminary Remark: Thus if a fraction of one class is less 
than a fraction of another class, then the same will be true for
all pairs of representatives of the two classes.
Proof: By Theorem 43, we have
y_1/y_2 > x_1/x_2;
since
y_1/y_2 ~ u_1/u_2, x_1/x_2 ~ z_1/z_2,
we then have by Theorem 44 that
u_1/u_2 > z_1/z_2,
so that, by Theorem 42,
z_1/z_2 < u_1/u_2.

Definition 11: x_1/x_2 \<greatersim> y_1/y_2
means
x_1/x_2 ~ y_1/y_2 or x_1/x_2 > y_1/y_2.
(\<greatersim> to be read "greater than or equivalent with.")

Definition 12: x_1/x_2 \<lesssim> y_1/y_2
means
x_1/x_2 < y_1/y_2 or x_1/x_2 ~ y_1/y_2.
(\<lesssim> to be read "less than or equivalent with.")

Theorem 46: If
x_1/x_2 \<greatersim> y_1/y_2, x_1/x_2 ~ z_1/z_2, y_1/y_2 ~ u_1/u_2
then
z_1/z_2 \<greatersim> u_1/u_2.
Proof: Obious by Theorem 44 if > holds in the hypothesis;
otherwise, we have
z_1/z_2 ~ x_1/x_2 ~ y_1/y_2 ~ u_1/u_2.
